# Welcome to anderson
_the only real deal_
[zebaki](http://www.zebaki.co.ke)
And the other _text_ just looks normal as it should over this [link](www.link)

Drawing tables is equally markedly easier than you might even try to think

## doing lists

1. home
  
1. two
3. three

- home
- age
  - young
  - old

__and this text is bold since it actually contains a drawn table__

As I have always put it:
> we need to live the future since the present
>and this
> is always here
> in which case
> the software might need to be used
> for free

__or better still draw a table to show some fansiness__

user age | preference
---------|-----------
19 | hiking
22 | relationships


First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

_and now how to do images_
